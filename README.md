# Slack Ingestion Module ‚Äì Spur Hacks 2025

This module ingests messages from all **public Slack channels** in a workspace, using a custom Slack app + bot, and stores them in a local **SQLite database** (`slack.db`).

> Part of the SpurHacks 2025 project to analyze team communication using LLMs.

---

## What This Module Does

- Connects to a Slack workspace using a Bot Token
- Iterates through all **public channels**
- Joins channels if the bot isn't already a member
- Extracts recent messages from each channel
- Saves each message (with timestamp, user, channel) into `slack.db`

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository and create a virtual environment

```bash
git checkout -b slack-ingestion
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file in the root

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token-here
```

> You get this token from your Slack App settings ‚Üí OAuth & Permissions.

---

### 3. Run the DB setup (only once)

```bash
python db_setup.py
```

---

### 4. Ingest messages

```bash
python slack_ingest.py
```

This will fetch messages from all public channels the bot can access and populate `slack.db`.
